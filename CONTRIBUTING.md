# Contributing to Fantasy Frontiers
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features (and implement them if you want)
- Becoming a maintainer
- Help us translate on [Weblate](https://weblate.flawcra.cc/projects/fantasy-frontiers/translations/)

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. (ik.. nobody ever does that)
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation for them.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (or at least that the project builds).
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL 3.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL 3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/CoasterFreakDE/FantasyFrontiers/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/CoasterFreakDE/FantasyFrontiers/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a good bug report. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [The stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Stay close to the languages code style
* You can look them up at [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
