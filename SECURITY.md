# Security Policy for FantasyFrontiers

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of FantasyFrontiers is currently being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our system seriously. If you find any security vulnerabilities within Nitro4Friends, please report them by following these guidelines:

### Steps for Reporting

1. **Do Not Report Security Vulnerabilities Publicly**: Discussing them in public could put the wider community at risk. Instead, please send a discreet email to the maintainers.

2. **Provide Details**: The more details provided about the vulnerability, the easier it will be for us to triage the issue. Please include steps to reproduce, or even better, a proof of concept.

3. **Allow Time for Triage**: Please allow reasonable time for the maintainers to triage and fix the vulnerability before disclosing it to others.

### Contact Information

To report a security vulnerability, please use the following means of contact: [Discord](https://discord.com/users/216487432667791360).

## Security Patch Policy

1. Once a security vulnerability has been reported, we will work to confirm the issue and assign it a severity level.

2. A fix will be implemented as soon as possible for severe vulnerabilities. For less critical issues, the fix may be included in the next scheduled update.

3. Once a fix has been implemented, we will update the Security Policy and other documentation as necessary.

4. If you have reported a vulnerability, we will credit you for the discovery in any public posts or communication, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
